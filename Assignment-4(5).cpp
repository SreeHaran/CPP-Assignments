/*Write a program that will output the sum of two
quadratic polynomials. Your program must do the
following:
i) Define an user defined datatype, Poly with three
private data members a, b and c(type double)to
represent the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial
in the form:
ax2 + bx + c

ii) Include a constructor in the Poly class to initialize
all private data members with caller-supplied values
(in addition to the default constructor!)
iii) Overload the addition operator to return the sum of
two Poly objects.
iv) Overload the << (output) operator to output Poly
objects in the following format, e.g.,: ax2 + bx + c

Where a, b and c are the coefficients of the Poly object.
Do not display the a or b terms if they have zero
coefficients. Moreover, if any coefficient is negative it
should be precede by a minus sign, and not a plus sign.
v) In your main() function, declare and initialize two
Poly objects, q1 and q2, to represent the following
polynomials: 3x2 + 4x â€“ 2 and -4x + 10 . Also declare a
third, un-initialized Poly object named sum.
vi) Output the sum of the two polynomials to the console
using the following C++ code exactly as it appears:
sum = q1 + q2;
cout << q1 << " : q1\n";
cout << q2 << " : q2\n";
cout << sum << " : q1+q2\n";*/
